# Tree
Tree is a non linear data structure which simulates a hierarchy.


tree ka level zero se shuru hota hai
height = num of edges from that particular node to its deepest descendant
depth = num of edges from root node to that particular node

for entire tree, height = depth;
but a random node in tree, height != depth (in most cases)


leaves: the nodes which have no child are leaves


##Types of trees:
1. Binary Tree: 
          Every node will have at most 2 children(i.e., 0 or 1 or 2 children)

TRY data structure 
yeh data structure jo hai bahut jyada values ko store karne mai kaam aayega
jaise ki ek dictionary hai, which has 1 million words, the other standard data structures ki aukkad nai hai
yeh store karne ki,
but if we use TRY data structure then we can easily store it.
