## Deadline: 13 October, 2022
1. How to get the middle node of a single linked list without counting number of nodes.
HINT: 2 pointer process, fast pointer and slow pointer.
Note: Don't count the number of nodes.
2. How to get kth node from end of a singly linked list, without findong num of nodes.
Note: Don't count the number of nodes.
3. merge two sorted singly linked list in sorted order
4. Solve the 3rd problem without creating 3rd linked list.
5. Clone a linked list
6. Detect whether LL contains a cycle(or loop)
           Output should be yes/no or true/false
7. In 6th problem, If cycle(loop) existed in the LL, then find the length of the cycle(loop).
8. In 6th problem, If cycle(loop) existed in the LL, then find the starting point.
9. Find the merging point of two LL
10. Reverse every pair of nodes in LL.
       if LL is 1->2->3->4->5->6->7
       then output:  2->1->4->3->6->5->7
11. Reverse every k num of nodes in LL.
12. Implement LRU (least recently used page replacement algorithm) using Linked List (submit after 1 year).
